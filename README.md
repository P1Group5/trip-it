### Purpose:

* As future developers, we wanted to create a website showcasing our current skills. We decided to make a webpage using new and different skills to create a webpage called Trip It to allow users to input travel destinations and dates they are planning to travel, so our webpage can offer flight options (date leaving and the options with the price, as well as a link to the external flight page), as well as offer a list of activities within a certain radius based off their airport they get off at. 

### Written with:
* HTML
* Bulma (CSS alternative)
* JS
* JQUERY
* MOMENT.JS

## Website:
https://p1group5.github.io/trip-it/

## Future Uses:
* Update to allow user to send suggestion in for different functions and uses
* Implement the weather page onto the results page
* Implement further future forecast
* Add prices onto the results page with the flights
* Add an option to partner with different companies for direct purchase options
* Add more options outside of flights (e.g. entertainment in the destination)
* Add more options for user input and output
